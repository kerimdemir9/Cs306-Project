
I used line chart in order to identify a long term trend that covers a 30 year interval across 6 countries that have above average numbers and above average gas emissions and try to find correlations between two fields. In all the countries except Russia, the deaths numbers seem to increase over time meanwhile it is decreasing for Russia which might imply that there might be another reason that must also be investigated to find the true relation or there might be some series of mistakes about the collection of the data. I visualized the emission for four different gases and plotted them using the logarithmic scale in order to make it possible for the viewer to capture smaller details. In a table of 6x2 images, the viewer can see the death numbers on the left hand side and the emission values on the right hand side.
